## Questions for Dylan
1. How do I get my page/footer to fill the whole screen without causing unnecessary scrolling? (Reference: Go to the login page and see how the footer is always too short for the screen size). I tried a couple different viewheight and viewwidth stuff but couldn't get it to work and was probably doing it wrong anyway >.<
